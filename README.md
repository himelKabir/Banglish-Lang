**Description:**  
Banglish Lang is a programming language developed using Bangla written in English alphabets (Banglish). Through this language, users can write code using Bangla words spelled in English. It supports basic programming concepts such as if-else, loops, functions, arrays, and strings with a simple syntax. The goal of this project is to make programming easier for native Bangla speakers, allowing them to code in their own language.

**Future Plans:**
    **To enhance usability and functionality, we plan to add:**
    **-Bangla syntax (বাংলা লিপি) support**
    **-Advanced error detection**
    **-Comprehensive Bangla documentation support**
