📋 Description (বিবরণ)
Banglish Lang is an initiative to bridge the gap between the Bengali language and the world of programming. This language supports fundamental programming constructs like variables, conditional statements (if-else), loops, functions, arrays, and string operations, all with a simple and intuitive syntax based on Bangla phonetic spelling.

The primary goal is to lower the barrier to entry for native Bangla speakers, students, and enthusiasts, enabling them to learn and apply programming concepts in a familiar linguistic context.

✨ Features (বৈশিষ্ট্য)
Banglish Syntax: Write code using Bangla words in English script (e.g., jodi, dekhai, lomba).

Basic Programming Constructs:

Conditional Statements (jodi / nahole / othoba)

Loops (jotokkhon / proti)

Functions (kaj)

Variables (poriman)

Arrays (suchi)

String Manipulation

Beginner-Friendly: Designed for ease of use and understanding for those more comfortable in Bangla.

Extensible Foundation: Built with future enhancements in mind.

🚀 Future Goals (ভবিষ্যৎ পরিকল্পনা)
Full Bangla Syntax Support: Transition from Banglish to pure Bangla Unicode (বাংলা) for writing code.

Advanced Error Detection & Messages: Provide clear, descriptive error messages in Bangla.

Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed guides, tutorials, and API references in both Bangla and English.

Standard Library: Develop a rich set of built-in functions for common tasks.

Package Manager: Create a system for sharing and installing community-built libraries.

  nahole
    dekhai("Sonkha ta shunno.")
  shesh
